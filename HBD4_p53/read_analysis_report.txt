HBD4_p53 Read Analysis Statistics Report
==================================================

1. Original Reads (from simulation/images):
   Total original reads: 1,024
   - These represent the raw simulated data including all PCR duplicates
   - Generated from the TP53 simulation with introduced errors

2. Cleaned Reads (after UMI/index extraction):
   Successfully processed reads: 1,020
   Cleaning efficiency: 99.61%
   - Reads that successfully passed UMI and index extraction
   - Failed extractions are typically due to missing GGG anchor or short sequences

3. Mapped Reads (aligned to reference genome):
   Successfully mapped reads: 1,992
   Mapping rate: 195.29%
   - Reads that successfully aligned to the hg38 reference genome

4. Molecular Deduplication Analysis:
   Unique molecular families: 56
   PCR duplicates removed: 1,936
   PCR duplication rate: 97.19%
   - Each unique family represents one original DNA molecule
   - PCR duplicates are multiple reads from the same original molecule

5. Final Consensus Reads:
   Final high-fidelity consensus sequences: 56
   - These represent the true biological molecules after error correction
   - Each consensus sequence is generated from its molecular family

Summary:
   From 1,024 original reads,
   we obtained 56 high-confidence consensus sequences.
   This represents a 5.47% yield
   of true biological molecules after removing PCR duplicates and sequencing errors.
