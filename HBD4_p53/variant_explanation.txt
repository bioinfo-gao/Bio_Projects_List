# Explanation of Variant Types in HBD Analysis

## true_variant
- Definition: Real biological variants that exist in the original DNA/RNA sample
- Characteristics:
  - Represent genuine mutations present in the patient's genome
  - Typically show consistent frequencies across multiple sequencing reads
  - Often found at moderate to high frequencies (e.g., 20-100% within a molecular family)
  - These are the variants of clinical interest for diagnostic purposes
  - May represent disease-causing mutations or polymorphisms

## low_abundance_variant
- Definition: Rare biological variants that exist at low levels in the original sample
- Characteristics:
  - Genuine biological variants but present at very low abundance (typically <5%)
  - May represent rare subclones, early mutations, or variants in a small subset of cells
  - Could indicate early-stage disease, minimal residual disease, or rare genetic variants
  - Require careful validation due to their low frequency
  - Distinguished from sequencing errors by their reproducibility across reads

## PCR_artifact
- Definition: Errors introduced during the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification process
- Two main categories based on timing of occurrence:

### Early PCR Artifacts (First Round of Amplification)
- Occur during the initial rounds of PCR amplification
- Characteristics:
  - Show high consistency within a molecular family (often 50-100% frequency)
  - Represent errors that got propagated to many copies early in the amplification process
  - Appear as consistent variants within a single UMI family
  - More likely to be mistaken for true biological variants

### Late PCR Artifacts (Later Rounds of Amplification)
- Occur during later rounds of PCR amplification
- Characteristics:
  - Show lower consistency within a molecular family (often <25-30% frequency)
  - Represent errors that occurred in only a few molecules later in amplification
  - Appear as inconsistent variants within a UMI family
  - Easier to distinguish from true variants due to low frequency

## Distinguishing Features
| Variant Type | Frequency Range | Consistency | Biological Relevance |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| true_variant | Variable (5%-100%) | High within families | High |
| low_abundance_variant | <5% | Moderate to High | High (if validated) |
| PCR_artifact (early) | 25%-100% | High | None |
| PCR_artifact (late) | <25% | Low | None |

## Detection Strategy
The HBD (Heavy Ballot Deduplication) method uses UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) sequences to:
1. Group reads by their original molecule of origin
2. Compare sequences within each UMI family
3. Identify consistent variants (likely true variants)
4. Identify inconsistent variants (likely PCR artifacts)
5. Apply frequency thresholds to distinguish between biological variants and artifacts
